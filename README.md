# Role Playing Back Bone

This is the beginnings of a web-based RPG. The game starts off by asking you to select a player. Once you have selected a player, click on them a second time to confirm your selection. The player you selected will then appear to the left of the screen and the other 3 characters will move to the right. The characters on the right are now your enemies. You must fight each one to the death. 

Game Play:
When you click on a character to fight, you will attack first. The amount of damage is calculated by picking a random number between you Attack Power and 0. The number returned will be the amount of damage you do. After the attack you will gain your original Attack Power + your current attack power. You cannot heal so be careful as to fight others with less attack power first. 

Thigs to do...
    Write a couple of functions to finish the game.
    1. To allow the player to keep playing after their first kill,
    2. Write the function for the end of the game to display final scores and high scores tables
